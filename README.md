A web based supply chain analytics platform that ingests CSV files, analyzes operational performance with automated rule based bottleneck detection, stores processed data in MySQL, and presents interactive dashboards for real time insights.
Built using Python, MySQL, React, Tailwind CSS, and Power BI.

🔍 Overview

SupplyChain Insight converts raw supply chain data into actionable intelligence.

Users can upload CSV files or use sample data, and the system automatically extracts fields, computes KPIs, detects bottlenecks, assigns severity levels, and visualizes everything through dynamic dashboards.

✨ Key Features
1. Automated Data Ingestion

-Upload CSV files or use sample datasets.

-Extracts fields like product, supplier, dates, costs, and quantities.

-Cleans, validates, and parses data automatically.

3. Advanced Metric Computation

-Days late

-Profit margins

-Shipping cost ratios

-Supplier performance indicators

-Region wise supply health scores

3. Bottleneck Detection Engine

-Rule based checks:

-Late shipments beyond threshold

-Low profit margins

-High shipping cost ratios

-Severity classification: Critical, High, Medium, Low

4. Data Storage Layer

-Processed and raw data stored in MySQL

-Supports persistence, querying, and scalable analysis

5. Interactive Visual Dashboards

-KPI summary cards: on time delivery, margins, issue counts

-Pie chart: bottleneck distribution

-Area chart: performance trends

-Bar chart: supplier reliability ranking

-Heatmap: regional supply chain health

-Advanced data table: search, sort, filter, pagination

-Actionable flags showing exactly which suppliers, products, or regions need attention
