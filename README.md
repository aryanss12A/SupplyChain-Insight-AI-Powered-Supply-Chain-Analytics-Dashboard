A web based supply chain analytics platform that ingests CSV files, analyzes operational performance with automated rule based bottleneck detection, stores processed data in MySQL, and presents interactive dashboards for real time insights.
Built using Python, MySQL, React, Tailwind CSS, and Power BI.

🔍 Overview

SupplyChain Insight converts raw supply chain data into actionable intelligence.

Users can upload CSV files or use sample data, and the system automatically extracts fields, computes KPIs, detects bottlenecks, assigns severity levels, and visualizes everything through dynamic dashboards.

✨ Key Features
1. Automated Data Ingestion

Upload CSV files or use sample datasets.

Extracts fields like product, supplier, dates, costs, and quantities.

Cleans, validates, and parses data automatically.

3. Advanced Metric Computation

Days late

Profit margins

Shipping cost ratios

Supplier performance indicators

Region wise supply health scores

3. Bottleneck Detection Engine

Rule based checks:

Late shipments beyond threshold

Low profit margins

High shipping cost ratios

Severity classification: Critical, High, Medium, Low

4. Data Storage Layer

Processed and raw data stored in MySQL

Supports persistence, querying, and scalable analysis

5. Interactive Visual Dashboards

KPI summary cards: on time delivery, margins, issue counts

Pie chart: bottleneck distribution

Area chart: performance trends

Bar chart: supplier reliability ranking

Heatmap: regional supply chain health

Advanced data table: search, sort, filter, pagination

Actionable flags showing exactly which suppliers, products, or regions need attention
